      We rely on Manticore daily as the backbone of our text analysis service, leveraging both its powerful core engine and Python API. The support from the Manticore team is exceptional—they're always responsive, knowledgeable, and eager to help.

      Among its many strengths, we particularly appreciate:

      - Efficient bulk inserts/updates for high-throughput operations.
      - Seamless container integration, simplifying deployment and scalability.
      - The flexible match() functionality, which enables precise and customizable querying.

      After evaluating multiple solutions with similar capabilities, we chose Manticore for its unmatched flexibility and rich feature set.

      I use Manticore for full-text search and love how fast the queries are. I'd give it 7/10—at some places the error messages need to be more clear, but the support team is great and I believe the project will keep getting better.
